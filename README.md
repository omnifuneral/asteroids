# Asteroids

A classic Asteroids-inspired game implemented using Pygame. This project is currently a **work in progress**, created as part of a learning journey with Boot.dev. Future updates will bring additional features and enhancements.

## Features

- **Spaceship Controls**: Navigate using `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys.
- **Asteroids**: Randomly generated with varying sizes and velocities.
- **Basic Collision Detection**: The spaceship interacts with asteroids and projectiles.
- **Projectiles**: Fire projectiles to destroy asteroids.

## Planned Features

- **Score Tracking**: Points awarded for destroying asteroids (coming soon!).
- **Power-ups**: Special abilities or upgrades for the spaceship.
- **Improved Graphics and Effects**: Enhanced visual and sound effects.
- **Levels**: Progressively harder waves of asteroids.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omnifuneral/asteroids.git
   cd asteroids
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start the game, run:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Controls
